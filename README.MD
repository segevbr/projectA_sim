On Going TODO list:
* Read about grid localization 
* Match robot object to real robot (one sensor, rotation fol additional measurements)
* Check: how deep should we go with simulating real sensor measurement (conial, noise, etc.)
* Consider other framework for the GUI to be more interactive 
* Create a for loop to imitate robot measurements  (i.e interacvite prob map change with robot movement)
